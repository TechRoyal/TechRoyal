# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Toby.

## IT Support Specialist, Freelance Developer and nerd.
Programming is a one-of-a-kind, unique way to express yourself, find solutions to problems or create something truly amazing. I use my skills in programming to create literally anything and everything. From simple Discord bots to complex guest tracking and management to automating my life up with processes that interact with all sorts of devices... yeah, I do a lot (most of it's crappy code though so it stays private.. too scary to release that stuff!).

### Skills:
Fluent in: JS (Web & Node), PHP, HTML, CSS, Batch & Bash Scripting, PowerShell. <br />
Developing skills in: Java (Focusing on Minecraft mostly), C#, LUA and others.
